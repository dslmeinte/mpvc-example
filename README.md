# README

This repository holds all the TypeScript source for the example used in my [MPVC Pattern blog](https://medium.com/@dslmeinte/the-mpvc-pattern-c1df8a027400), reproduced [here](./MPVC-blog-text.md).


## Installation

The implementation requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and either [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes installed with Node.js) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).
(I'll assume NPM from now on, and assume you can translate to Yarn yourself.)
Run `npm i`, and then `npm start` to build and start the example application on [`http://localhost:9000/`](http://localhost:9000/).
By running `npm run watch` next to it, you can adjust the code and build it incrementally - I didn't set up hot reloading, though.
